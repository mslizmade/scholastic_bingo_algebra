## Description
This bingo game serves as a standalone remote-learning activity.  The version provided in this repository is based on an algebra learning target: factoring polynomials.  However, a teacher is welcome to request a customized version upon verifying their teaching credentials with me.  Some subjects that lend themselves to this bingo activity include:
* Science
  * identifying parts of a biological diagram
  * coefficients of a correctly-balanced chemical reaction
  * scientific contributions & scientist name
* History, Geography, & Civics
  * event & date
  * identifying geographic location by outline
  * law synopses & their names
* English
  * vocabulary definitions
  * parts of speech
  * composition & genre matching
* Music, Art, & Architecture
  * piece & artist
  * soundbytes & bars of rhythm
  * key signatures in a staff & key by letter

## Custom Installation
After customization, I will send you two html files: yourname_bingocaller.html and yourname_bingoboard.html
Share yourname_bingoboard.html with your students in one of the following ways:
* upload it to your personal portal within your school's website so it has a proprietary URL
* share it with your students to download individually via google drive, email, etc
* copy the content to an html viewer like codepen.io (less than ideal, but it's a free option for those in a pinch)

## Custom Usage
To play, open yourname_bingocaller.html on your computer's shared screen. Instruct your students to open yourname_bingoboard.html in the manner befitting the method by which you shared it.
